Hello,

These are the projects I would like to share to demonstrate my skills with coding. These projects utilize C++ and showcase skills such as utilization of data structures
and proficient problem solving skills. Please check them out to get a measure of my abilities!

Othello- Makes a game of Othello, where each player takes turn placing pieces to capture the opposite color pieces. However has the most pieces when there are no more legal moves to be made, they win. Can also play against AI players.
